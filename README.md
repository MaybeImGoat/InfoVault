Project Background: This project is my first real project that has any worth. Back in highschool i used to code for some of my classes, and while i was working on a smaller fun project i remembered that i had learned what i was trying to do before, but i just couldn't remember it. so i went and looked online but i couldn't find anything that had explained it well enough for me to really understand it how i used to. it took me a few hours until i finally figured it out, and it gave me an idea. what if i dont have to worry about relearning things from the internet? obviously its impossible to never have to look things up to learn them to begin with... but relearning them i could do. so i made this project. its essentialy a database browser that can browse through a MongoDB Database and find you entries that YOU wrote. i found that one of the main issues with looking for answers online was that everyone thinks differently, so what might be a perfect way to explain something in your mind might not work for me, and vice versa. so i wanted to make a way that when i learn something, i can commit it to the database, and then if for whatever reason i forget it, its already explained in a BROAD AND GENERAL way to myself in the database, so that relearning that information is as easy as forgetting it.
